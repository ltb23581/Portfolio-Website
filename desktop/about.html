        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <h2>I'm a Computer Science student</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Lindsay Bui, and I am a third-year
          computer science student concentrating in software design at the
          University of Georgia. Alongside my major, I am pursuing the New Media
          Certificate (Development track) and am a member of the UGA CyberArch
          Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my passion for technology, I also have a love for
          learning about different cultures. Through high school to now, I
          studied Spanish for one year and Japanese and Korean for two. I am of
          Vietnamese descent; however, I wasn't fully taught the language
          growing up, so I only know basic vocabulary and conversation.
          Currently, my strongest language, aside from English (which is my
          native language), is Korean. During the Spring 2025 term, I plan to
          study at Korea University to strengthen my cultural and language
          skills while continuing my studies in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up in a household of six, I was always known as the "creative
          child." When it came time to choose a major, I found myself torn
          between two options: architecture and computer science. I loved art
          and design but also dreamed of pursuing coding. Ultimately, I chose
          computer science, a field that allows me to blend my creative passion
          with my technical skills in web, app, and game development.
